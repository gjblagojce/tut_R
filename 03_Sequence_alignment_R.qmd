# 🧬 Pairwise Sequence Alignment in R

This notebook demonstrates how to perform **global** and **local** sequence alignments in R using the `Biostrings` package from Bioconductor. You will:

-   Learn about alignment types
-   Set scoring systems
-   Perform alignments
-   View alignment scores and results.

## 🔄 Types of Pairwise Alignments

-   **Global alignment**: Aligns sequences end-to-end. Use when sequences are similar in length and origin.
-   **Local alignment**: Finds best-matching local regions. Useful when comparing distant homologs.

## 📦 Setup and Import

```{r}
library(Biostrings)
library(pwalign)
```

## 1️⃣ Global Alignment (Match = 1, Mismatch = 0, No Gap Penalties)

This mimics a basic global alignment where only matches contribute to the score.

```{r}
seq1 <- DNAString("AAGGTT")
seq2 <- DNAString("AGTTAG")

alignment1 <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, substitutionMatrix = pwalign::nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix(match = 1, mismatch = 0, baseOnly = TRUE),
                                gapOpening = 0, gapExtension = 0, type = "global")

alignment1
cat("Score:", score(alignment1), "\n")

```

## 2️⃣ Global Alignment (Match = 2, Mismatch = -1)

```{r}
alignment2 <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, substitutionMatrix = pwalign::nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix(match = 2, mismatch = -1, baseOnly = TRUE),
                                gapOpening = 0, gapExtension = 0, type = "global")

alignment2
cat("Score:", score(alignment2), "\n")

```

## 3️⃣ Global Alignment with Gap Penalties

```{r}
alignment3 <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2, substitutionMatrix = pwalign::nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix(match = 2, mismatch = -1, baseOnly = TRUE),
                                gapOpening = -2, gapExtension = -0.5, type = "global")

alignment3
cat("Score:", score(alignment3), "\n")

```

## 4️⃣ Local Alignment

```{r}
# Define sequences
seq1 <- DNAString("AAGGTT")
seq2 <- DNAString("AGTTAG")

# Perform local alignment
alignment4 <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(
  seq1, seq2,
  substitutionMatrix = pwalign::nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix(match = 2, mismatch = -1, baseOnly = TRUE),
  gapOpening = -2,
  gapExtension = -0.5,
  type = "local"
)

# Show alignment and score
cat("Score:", score(alignment4), "\n")

```

## ✅ Summary

You learned how to: - Perform global and local alignments - Set scoring and gap penalties - Use Biostrings for pairwise sequence alignment in R
